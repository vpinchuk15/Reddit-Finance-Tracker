# Reddit Finance Tracker

This repo is used to analyze latest mentions of cashtags in Subreddits 



## Installation
Utilize any Python 3.X version and install the requirements.txt with pip. I suggest you use a virtual environment.

Additionally make sure you have your PostgreSQL Database set up to manipulate data with SQL queries.
(Change the config file with your DB info)


## Lessons 

This is not financial advice, if you do see your stock tag dominating in the subreddits, take your profits, believe me.
