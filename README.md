# Reddit Finance Tracker

This repo is used to analyze latest mentions of cashtags in Subreddits 



## Installation
Utilize any Python 3.X version and install the requirements.txt with pip. I suggest you use a virtual environment.

Additionally make sure you have your PostgreSQL Database set up to manipulate data with SQL queries.
(Change the config file with your DB info)

For this to work, you have to populate your stocks table, so the tracker can compare cashtags taken from reddit against real cashtags.
Any free API for stocks would work.


## Lessons 

This is not financial advice, if you do see your stock tag dominating in the subreddits, take your profits, believe me.
